## üìã Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js 18+ (for local development)
- Python 3.9+ (for local development)
- Cerebras API key

### Environment Setup

1.  **Clone the repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rajshah9305/AICREWAGENTSAPPP.git
    cd AICREWAGENTSAPPP
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment Variables**

    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project based on `.env.example`:

    ```dotenv
    # Cerebras API Key (Required)
    CEREBRAS_API_KEY=your_cerebras_api_key

    # PostgreSQL Database (for Docker Compose)
    POSTGRES_USER=crewdeck_user
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD=crewdeck_password
    POSTGRES_DB=crewdeck_db
    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://crewdeck_user:crewdeck_password@db:5432/crewdeck_db

    # JWT Authentication
    SECRET_KEY=your_super_secret_jwt_key
    ALGORITHM=HS256
    ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30

    # Frontend Configuration
    NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
    ```

3.  **Build and Run with Docker Compose**

    Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed. From the root of the project, run:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

    This will build the Docker images for both backend and frontend, and start the services. The backend will be available at `http://localhost:8000` and the frontend at `http://localhost:3000`.

4.  **Database Migrations**

    After the services are up, run database migrations for the backend:

    ```bash
    docker-compose exec backend alembic upgrade head
    ```

## üöÄ Usage

Once the application is running:

1.  **Access the Frontend**: Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
2.  **Sign Up/Login**: Create a new account or log in with existing credentials.
3.  **Explore CrewDeck**: Start executing tasks with pre-configured AI agent teams or create your own.
